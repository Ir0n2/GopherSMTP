***GopherSMTP***

**What is GopherSMTP?**

		GopherSMTP is a SMTP phishing tool written in golang that (at it's core) automates sending emails. GopherSMTP also takes advantage of smtp to sms gateways to create convincing sms messages.
		Basically it's a terminal tool that lets you send scary emails and texts. 

**Here's what you can do:**

	1: send single email
	2: send to multiple emails 
	3: smsOverSmtp
	4: Send smsOverSmtp to multiple numbers
	5: Set email
	6: Spam emails
	7. Spam smsOverSmtp

**What would I like to add**

	I would like to add an option for google gemini to generate a phishing message.

**Who made this?**

	I made this! Ir0n2

**Why would you use this?**

	I don't know. To scare your friends. It makes a fun prank.

**Where can I use this software?**

	You can use this on damn near anything with a golang compiler and an internet connection.

**When is this useful?**

	This isn't useful unless you want to scare someone and know what you're doing. An example of how to use it is when my friend got his shots. 	
	I know what hospital he goes to, so I made a gmail in the hospitals name and used smtpToSmS to tell him his shot was contaminated with HIV.
	Pranks are fun :)

**How do I install it?**

`step 1: have golang installed`

`step 2: git clone https://github.com/Ir0n2/GopherSMTP`

`step 3: cd GopherSMTP`

`step 4 create AttackerEmails.txt and enter your email on the row and app password on the second row`

`go run email.go`

*You literally just need to put your email and app password in "AttackerEmails.txt", then run the go file...*
